The `Learning` repository is available at
https://github.com/uuhhhh/Learning/tree/ab37ad17b0835962ec6536b577966aa06a7aa749
Its `README.md` contains a lot of information and documentation about the project,
including the "Software Design Notes" section,
which has essential information about how I designed this software.
There are also UML diagrams to go along with this design document, located in
the `uml` folder in the repository.
The code itself is also well-documented.

The `build-windows` and `build-linux` folders contains executable builds of the game
for Windows (`Learning.exe`) and Linux (`Learning.x86_64`), respectively.
The controls and features of this game are detailed in the `README.md` in the
`Learning` repository.

Please note that the software design is the main feature of this project,
rather than the game itself. The game is an example of what can be done
with the design.
