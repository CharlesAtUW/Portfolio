Information for each portfolio item is in their respective folders.

The names of each project link to their respective repositories.

The `README.md` file in each of these folders also provides information and context about the portfolio project.

Here are brief descriptions of the projects in each of the folders:

---
### [Learning](https://github.com/uuhhhh/Learning)
- August-September 2023 and December 2023-January 2024
- Godot, C#

This personal project serves as a base for a 2D game in the Godot game engine.
The main thing about this project is its software design/architecture,
which allows complex movement to be achieved while keeping the causes of this
movement modular and reusable.
This project was done by me individually.

### [Huffman Exercise](https://github.com/CharlesAtUW/HuffmanExercise)
- January 2024
- C++

This small project/code sample is a file compressor/decompressor
that follows the Huffman algorithm.
This project was done by me individually.

### [RecipeCart](https://github.com/jteng2/CSE-403-RecipeCart/)
- January-March 2023
- Java

This software engineering class project is a website where users can upload
and keep track of recipes, as well as keeping track of a shopping list of ingredients.
What's unique about this project is its capability to add the ingredients
of a given recipe (and their specified amounts) to the shopping list
(with the option of adding only the ingredients the user is missing).
This project was a collaborative effort, where I did most of the code
for the backend server, as well as contributing to the project's documentation
and requirements document.
